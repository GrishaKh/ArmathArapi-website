## Overview

TalkFreely is an innovative project that aims to provide a natural language-based interface for controlling various devices and getting assistance with everyday tasks. The project was created to meet the diverse needs of users across different domains and applications.

## Project Details

TalkFreely represents a breakthrough in human-device interaction. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API and the gpt-3.5-turbo model, TalkFreely understands user commands and controls devices. The project is divided into two modules: natural language processing (Python) and device control (ESP8266).

The system's ability to understand context-based commands and various phrasings makes it intuitive and user-friendly. Users can communicate with their devices in natural language, making technology more accessible and convenient.
