## Overview

LogicGateSimulator is an interactive educational simulation tool designed to teach and learn digital logic gates. The project is built entirely in Scratch 3, showcasing that educational tools can themselves become powerful learning platforms.

## Project Details

The simulator demonstrates sophisticated programming concepts within the accessible Scratch environment. Using Scratch lists to store logical elements, ports, and connections, the project creates a complex data structure that supports realistic logic gate simulation.

The iterative calculation algorithm ensures that the system can handle feedback loops and reach stable states, making it a practical tool for understanding digital logic concepts. Teachers can use this tool in classrooms to visually explain logic gates, helping students grasp fundamental concepts in computer science and electronics.
