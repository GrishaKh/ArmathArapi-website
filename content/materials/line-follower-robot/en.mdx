## Lab Focus

Students move beyond assembling a robot and focus on performance engineering. The worksheet guides experiments where each calibration change is measured and logged.

## Experiment Sequence

1. Measure baseline lap time and drift points.
2. Calibrate each IR sensor under different lighting.
3. Adjust correction values for left/right turns.
4. Re-run timed laps and compare consistency.
5. Present which tuning choices improved control.

## Evaluation

The main success metric is not speed alone. Students are assessed on stability, repeatability, and ability to explain why a tuning change improved behavior.
