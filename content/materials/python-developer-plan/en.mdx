## Program Goal

This track turns foundation-level learners into practical Python builders. Every module ends in implementation tasks that simulate real-world development workflow.

## Delivery Model

- Duration: 16 weeks
- Frequency: 2 sessions per week
- Session length: 90 minutes
- Total sessions: 32

## Module Breakdown

### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals (Weeks 1-4)

- Python syntax and clean code conventions
- Control flow with conditions and loops
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples
- Functions and modular files

### Phase 2: Problem Solving and Data Work (Weeks 5-8)

- String/list problem-solving drills
- File input/output and CSV basics
- Error handling with `try/except`
- Mini Project 1: Data utility CLI tool

### Phase 3: Practical Automation and APIs (Weeks 9-12)

- Modules, package usage, and reusable code
- HTTP requests and JSON response handling
- Local automation scripts for repetitive tasks
- Mini Project 2: API-driven reporting utility

### Phase 4: Product Delivery Cycle (Weeks 13-16)

- Product definition and architecture draft
- Implementation sprint
- Refactor, test, and documentation pass
- Final defense and public demo

## Assessment Framework

- Weekly labs and assignments: 40%
- Quizzes and concept checks: 20%
- Mini projects + final product: 40%

## Final Project Requirements

- Clear user problem and scope
- Working Python application
- Test cases and debugging evidence
- Short technical documentation
- Live demo and Q&A

## Graduate Profile

Students completing this track are ready for advanced paths in backend development, robotics programming, or data-focused projects.
