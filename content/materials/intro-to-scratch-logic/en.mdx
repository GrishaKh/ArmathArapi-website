## Lesson Overview

This lesson helps students connect abstract logic ideas to interactive visual blocks in Scratch. The class starts with physical examples ("both buttons pressed", "at least one switch on"), then transitions to a simulator built by students.

## Steps

1. Introduce `true` and `false` with classroom examples.
2. Build two input switches in Scratch.
3. Add scripts that simulate AND, OR, and NOT.
4. Test all input combinations and record results.
5. Present mini demos in groups.

## Reflection

Students explain how the same logic applies to sensors, robotics decisions, and game rules. This gives a foundation for later electronics and programming modules.
