## Program Goal

This plan builds strong foundations before students move into specialized development tracks. The emphasis is practical: each concept is directly connected to mini tasks and a final build.

## Delivery Model

- Duration: 16 weeks
- Frequency: 2 sessions per week
- Session length: 90 minutes
- Total sessions: 32

## Weekly Session Structure

1. Warm-up and recap (10 minutes)
2. New concept and live demo (25 minutes)
3. Guided coding practice (35 minutes)
4. Mini challenge / teamwork task (15 minutes)
5. Reflection and homework briefing (5 minutes)

## Module Breakdown

### Phase 1: Computational Thinking (Weeks 1-4)

- Algorithms, decomposition, and sequencing
- Conditions and boolean logic
- Loops and repetition design
- Debugging mindset and test-case thinking

### Phase 2: Block-to-Text Transition (Weeks 5-8)

- Variables and data types
- Functions and modular logic
- Inputs/outputs and event flow
- Mini Project 1: Interactive logic/game prototype

### Phase 3: Core Programming Patterns (Weeks 9-12)

- Lists and indexing
- String operations and parsing basics
- Nested conditions and loop control
- Mini Project 2: Utility simulator or educational app

### Phase 4: Final Build Cycle (Weeks 13-16)

- Scope definition and project planning
- Implementation sprint
- Testing and bug-fix sprint
- Demo day with peer review

## Assessment Framework

- Weekly labs and homework: 40%
- Concept quizzes: 20%
- Mini projects + final project: 40%

## Final Deliverables

- Two mini projects
- One final project
- Project presentation with problem, solution, and lessons learned

## Progression After Completion

Students who complete this track are ready to enter the Python Developer educational plan.
