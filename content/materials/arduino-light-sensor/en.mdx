## Project Context

Students often see sensors as black boxes. This activity breaks the process into measurable steps and teaches how to move from raw values to meaningful automation behavior.

## Build Flow

1. Assemble a voltage divider with an LDR and fixed resistor.
2. Upload a basic sketch that prints sensor values.
3. Observe day/night readings and choose a threshold.
4. Add LED output logic and test edge cases.
5. Discuss improvements such as smoothing and hysteresis.

## Extension Ideas

- Add multiple sensors and compare readings.
- Control a relay module after safety review.
- Log values over time and graph them in class.
