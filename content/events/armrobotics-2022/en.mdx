## Participation

On December 11, 2022, the 14th Armenian Robotics Championship, "ArmRobotics", took place at the Dilijan Central School. Students from the "Family" Center in Gyumri, and the "Armath" laboratories of Meghrashen and Arapi participated as a united team. The competition was organized by the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE).

## Challenge

The theme of the competition was "Smart Farm". Our team was tasked with designing and building an autonomous robot that would solve farm agro-problems using pre-programmed automated solutions.
Main tasks included:
*   Harvesting
*   Watering plants and gardens
*   Feeding animals
*   Planting seeds
*   Analysis and monitoring of crops, land, and animals

## Achievements

Our team developed and presented an innovative system combining computer vision and complex control algorithms.
*   **AI-powered Animal Recognition:** Used a smartphone camera to capture and send images in real-time, which were processed on a computer to identify animals.
*   **PID Algorithm:** Implemented a precise line-tracking algorithm that automatically adjusted to environmental lighting in advance.
*   **Teamwork:** Demonstrated effective collaboration between students from different laboratories.

## Results

Participation in "ArmRobotics" gave our students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in robotics, programming, and electronics, solving real-world problems and developing engineering thinking.
