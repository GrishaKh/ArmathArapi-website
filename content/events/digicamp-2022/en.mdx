## Our Participation

In the summer of 2022, students from the Armath engineering makerspaces of Arapi, Vardakar, and Lanjik formed a unified team and traveled to Dilijan with great enthusiasm to participate in the DigiCamp 2022 technological camp. For us, this was not just a camp, but an opportunity to try to turn our idea into a real product.

## The Power of Collaboration

We were among the first in the Shirak region to practically demonstrate the importance of a collaborative culture. By uniting the potential of Arapi, Vardakar, and Lanjik, we proved that **through collaboration, it is possible to form such powerful teams that are impossible to create when acting in isolation**.

Our team presented the **"Chatrak"** (Smart Chess) idea, the goal of which was to make chess learning and playing more interesting and interactive through technological solutions.

## Camp Routine

DigiCamp was held in a "triathlon" format, based on three important pillars: **Mind, Culture, and Physical Education**.

Over the course of 10 days, we lived a packed schedule:
*   **Mind**: We attended lectures, developed our startup's business model with the help of mentors, and learned to do market research and pitching.
*   **Culture**: We got acquainted with national dances and songs and participated in cultural events.
*   **Physical Education**: Morning exercises and sports games were an integral part of our daily routine.

## What DigiCamp Gave Us

This camp became a platform for great experience for us. We learned to work as one unified team, overcome disagreements, and focus on a common goal. Although the competition was heated and all teams presented interesting ideas, the most important achievement was the knowledge and friends we gained during those days spent at the "Monte Melkonian" College in Dilijan.
