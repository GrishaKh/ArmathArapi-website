## Summary

DigiCode is a prestigious national digital innovation competition bringing together talented students to showcase their programming and digital design projects. In 2025, Olya Khachatryan from Arapi Secondary School participated with the LogicGateSimulator project and successfully advanced through the republican stage of the competition.

## Challenge

DigiCode challenges students to create innovative digital solutions that demonstrate technical skill, creativity, and practical application. Participants develop original projects and compete against talented students from across Armenia, presenting their work to judges and industry experts.

## Achievements

- Successfully advanced through the republican stage of DigiCode 2025
- Created the LogicGateSimulator - an educational tool built entirely in Scratch
- Demonstrated how students can transition from learning with tools to creating useful applications
- Showcased practical educational value through interactive digital simulations

## Results

Olya's LogicGateSimulator was recognized at DigiCode 2025 as a valuable educational tool. By passing the republican stage, the project demonstrated that students learning Scratch can create real, useful tools - not just practice exercises - providing motivation for other young programmers.
