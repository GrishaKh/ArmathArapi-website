## Participation and Journey

From March 3-12, under the initiative and coordination of the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), the Armath "Armathronics 15" team represented Armenia at the "FIRST Robotics" competition in the USA. This was a historic event, as it was Armenia's first participation in this world-renowned competition.

The first stage of the competition took place in Ventura, California, with 53 teams participating. Our robot successfully passed the qualification, followed by the main competition days:
*   **March 8:** The team participated in 6 matches, winning 5 of them.
*   **March 9:** 3 matches were held, and the team won all 3.

As a result, our team secured 4th place in the overall ranking.

## Achievements: "Rookie All Star"

Due to the exceptional results and team spirit demonstrated at the Ventura competition, "Armathronics 15" was awarded the special **"Rookie All Star"** (Best Beginner Team) award. This victory granted the team a ticket to the final stage of the competition, which took place in April in Texas.

In the finals, competing against 601 teams from various countries (USA, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Japan, France, etc.), our team ranked among the top 8 "Rookie All Star" award winners.

## Team and Mentors

The "Armathronics 15" team included students from "Armath" laboratories in Gegharkunik, Tavush, and Shirak regions, including Narek Saroyan from Arapi.

The team's success was also due to the work of dedicated mentors and coordinators:
*   **Coaches:** Shahen Arabachyan (Ijevan "Real School" "Armath in the Air" UAV lab), Zhenya Kirakosyan, Arsen Yolyan.
*   **Coordinator:** Anahit Budaghyan (UATE International Relations Coordinator).

## Impact

Participating in FIRST Robotics was not only a great success for the Armenian team but also an important step in the development of STEM education in Armenia and showcasing our country's engineering potential on the international stage. The Armathians returned with new knowledge, inspiration, and readiness to apply their experience in future seasons.
