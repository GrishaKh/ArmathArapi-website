# Educational Plan v1: Programming Foundations + Python

## 1) Program Scope

- Audience: Ages 11-17 (split into beginner and intermediate groups if needed).
- Format: 2 sessions per week, 90 minutes each.
- Duration: 32 weeks total.
- Tracks:
  - Track A: Programming Foundations (16 weeks)
  - Track B: Python Developer Track (16 weeks)

## 2) Weekly Session Template (90 min)

- 10 min: Warm-up challenge / recap
- 25 min: New concept + live demo
- 35 min: Guided practice
- 15 min: Mini project task
- 5 min: Reflection + homework

## 3) Track A: Programming Foundations (16 weeks)

### Phase A1: Computational Thinking (Weeks 1-4)

- Week 1: Algorithms, sequence, decomposition.
- Week 2: Conditions and boolean logic.
- Week 3: Loops and repetition patterns.
- Week 4: Debugging mindset and test cases.

### Phase A2: Block-to-Text Transition (Weeks 5-8)

- Week 5: Variables, data types, naming rules.
- Week 6: Functions and modular thinking.
- Week 7: Input/output and event flow.
- Week 8: Mini Project 1 (interactive logic/game).

### Phase A3: Core Programming Patterns (Weeks 9-12)

- Week 9: Lists/arrays and indexing.
- Week 10: String operations and parsing basics.
- Week 11: Nested logic and loop control.
- Week 12: Mini Project 2 (utility app/simulator).

### Phase A4: Project Build + Presentation (Weeks 13-16)

- Week 13: Project planning (problem, scope, milestones).
- Week 14: Implementation sprint.
- Week 15: Testing, bug fixes, improvement pass.
- Week 16: Demo day + peer review.

### Track A Outcomes

- Students can write structured programs with conditions, loops, and functions.
- Students can debug using test inputs and expected outputs.
- Students can present a small project with clear problem-solution narrative.

## 4) Track B: Python Developer Track (16 weeks)

### Prerequisites

- Completion of Track A or equivalent skills.

### Phase B1: Python Fundamentals (Weeks 1-4)

- Week 1: Python syntax, variables, input/output.
- Week 2: Conditionals and loops in Python.
- Week 3: Lists, dictionaries, tuples.
- Week 4: Functions and code organization.

### Phase B2: Problem Solving and Data (Weeks 5-8)

- Week 5: String/list problem-solving exercises.
- Week 6: File I/O (read/write text, CSV basics).
- Week 7: Error handling (`try/except`) and validation.
- Week 8: Mini Project 1 (data utility tool).

### Phase B3: Practical Python Applications (Weeks 9-12)

- Week 9: Modules, packages, reusable code.
- Week 10: APIs basics (`requests`, JSON parsing).
- Week 11: Automation scripts (real local tasks).
- Week 12: Mini Project 2 (API + local output app).

### Phase B4: Final Product Cycle (Weeks 13-16)

- Week 13: Product definition and technical plan.
- Week 14: Implementation sprint.
- Week 15: Testing, refactor, documentation.
- Week 16: Final defense + showcase.

### Track B Outcomes

- Students can build Python CLI utilities and mini applications.
- Students can consume APIs and process real-world data.
- Students can deliver a tested, documented final Python project.

## 5) Assessment Model

- 40% Weekly labs and homework
- 20% Quizzes (concept checks)
- 40% Projects (mini projects + final project)

### Project Rubric (100 pts)

- Problem clarity: 15
- Technical correctness: 30
- Code quality/readability: 20
- Testing and debugging evidence: 15
- Demo and communication: 20

## 6) Leveling and Group Rules

- Entry diagnostic in Week 0 (logic + basic coding tasks).
- Group A (Beginners): slower pace, more guided scaffolding.
- Group B (Intermediate): faster pace, higher autonomy.
- Promotion checkpoint every 8 weeks.

## 7) Required Infrastructure

- Tools: Scratch (early phase), Python 3.11+, VS Code.
- Hardware (optional labs): Arduino kit + sensors.
- Collaboration: GitHub classroom or shared repo per group.

## 8) Deliverables per Student

- Track A: 2 mini projects + 1 final project.
- Track B: 2 mini Python projects + 1 final Python product.
- Portfolio: brief project write-up, screenshots, and source code links.

## 9) Immediate Next Step (Execution)

Create 8 concrete classroom-ready lesson packs from this plan:
- 4 from Track A (Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16)
- 4 from Track B (Weeks 1, 6, 12, 16)

Each pack should include:
- Instructor script
- Slides outline
- Student worksheet
- Homework with answer key
